# abs-labour-force
ABS Labour Force dataviz - a project to analyse selected data series from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, from their [Labour Force, Detailed series](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/labour/employment-and-unemployment/labour-force-australia-detailed/latest-release). 

Rather than presenting raw counts of people, the data is standardised by reference to the Labour Force Size by **Geography** and **Month**, eg as **# Employed / 1M**. This standardises comparisons across the Geographies (national, states/territories) and also over time (workforce and population growth).

Data updated from ABS Release of 24/07/2025, Reference period: June 2025.


## EM2 (Employed persons who worked fewer hours than usual) - Line Chart 

Choose a **Reason worked fewer hours than usual** and select **Geography, Age Group, Gender** or **Hours actually worked**. Shows the **# Employed / 1M** (standardised by Labour Force Size per Geography and Month) and also a 12-month rolling average.

## EM2 (Employed persons who worked fewer hours than usual) - Line Chart by State or Territory

Choose a **Reason worked fewer hours than usual** and select **Geography, Age Group, Gender** or **Hours actually worked**. Can choose which Metric to display, eg **# Employed** for the raw counts, or my preference: **# Employed (12M Avg) / 1M** - the 12-month rolling average of **# Employed**, divided by the Labour Force Size (per Geography and Month), in Millions of workers.

## NM2 (Persons not in the labour force) - Line Chart

Choose a **Reason not in the labour force** and select **Geography** for a time series analysis. Shows the **# Not in the labour force / 1M** (standardised by Labour Force Size per Geography and Month) and also a 12-month rolling average.

## Reference:

Various series from the ABS [Labour Force, Detailed series](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/labour/employment-and-unemployment/labour-force-australia-detailed/latest-release) are loaded into a [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) report for interactive analysis. The report is published as an interactive dataviz.

The EM2 (Employed persons who worked fewer hours than usual) series provides monthly counts segregated by Geography, Age Group, Sex, Hours actually worked and the Reason worked fewer hours than usual.  These are combined with the Labour Force Size series (see below) for a series of analysis pages to explore the trends over time. 

The NM2 (Persons not in the labour force) series provides counts segregated by Geography and Reason not in the labour force.  These are combined with the Labour Force Size series (see below) for a series of analysis pages. These are combined with the Labour Force Size series (see below) for an analysis page. 

The Labour Force Size data is integrated from the [ABS Labour Force dataset](https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/labour/employment-and-unemployment/labour-force-australia/latest-release), Table 12 Labour force status by Sex, State and Territory (file: 6202012.xslx). Rather than presenting raw counts of people from the series above, the data is standardised by reference to the Labour Force Size by **Geography** and **Month**, eg as **# Employed / 1M**. This standardises comparisons across the Geographies (national, states/territories with widely varying sizes) and also over time (workforce and population growth).  Note this data is not integrated by **Age Group** or **Sex** at this point. 


## Summary

The **EM2 Line Chart** page shows a time series chart with a 12-month rolling average line added to smooth the trends in the raw data. Choose a **Reason worked fewer hours than usual**. The view can be further filtered by **Geography, Age Group, Sex** or **Hours actually worked**.
